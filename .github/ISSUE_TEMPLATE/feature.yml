        Important things:

        - We expect you to submit a feature request including a real design (API / UI...), not just a basic idea.
        - The design does not have to be perfect, we'll discuss it and fix it if needed.

        If you do check this box, please send a pull request within 7 days after a maintainer's approval so we can still delegate this to someone else.

        Note that for feature issues, we still require you to fully fill out this form and reach consensus with the maintainers on API design before rushing to implement it, so that you don't waste your time.

        - label: I'd be willing to contribute this feature to Readout myself.
